Column statistics in Hive
- Collecting metadata on the data stored in the database is essential.
- Hive is a data warehousing solution implemented on top of Hadoop MapReduce framework.
- Hadoop is identified as one of the better framework to handle batch processing.
- Using Hive it is possible to generate tables and partitions where data is stored.
- A better approach to increase performance is by using statistics that describes data stored 
  in database system.
- Column level statistics are helpful to determine order of joins or to evaluate possible 
  values or map reduce programs.

Solution
- Implement column statistics in Hive for performance insrease.
- Extend Hive MetaStore which stores metadata that has been extracted on the column level of
  the user database.
- Collecting metadata on column level gives more accuracy.


Issues
- Metadata collection impose extra overhead for the database.
- Column level statistics gives more accuracy but very extensive compared to row level statistics.
- Collecting data on the column level can be very storage intensive.
- It is a tradeoff between accurancy and storage costs.

Approach
- A separate extension in form of additional MetaStore table that stores information on each column 
  associated with a specific table.
- Collect number of distinct values, number of null values, minimum values, maximum values, highest 
  frequency value.

Notes
- This paper does not give anything directly that applies to our project. We can use this as an
  explicit reference if needed to show that as well as column store implementation, gathering 
  column statistics in terms of metadata is necessary and can be implemented in MapReduce framework.
