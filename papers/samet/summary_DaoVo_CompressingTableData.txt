This paper formalizes the notion of column dependency as a way to capture information redundancy across columns and discusses how to automatically compute and use it to substantially improve table compression. It discusses a compression technique for table data based on discovering dependency relations among the columns of a table and using them to transform the data to enhance compressibility. Assuming some measure to assess the strength of column dependency, the notion of a k-transform is introduced to represent a data transformation plan based on column dependency. Although for k â‰¥ 2, the problem of finding an optimum k-transform is NP-hard, the authors present an algorithm for the optimum branching problem in directed graphs. The authors introduce two measures of entropy to assess dependency strength:
- conditional empirical entropy and 
- run-length compressive entropy.

According to the authors, experiments based on a variety of table data show that the presented algorithm performs well. They experiment the performance and put the sytem in a benchmark with Pzip. The results show that their system outperforms Pzip. According to the authors, Pzip represents a significant improvement over conventional techniques for compressing table data. However, its method of grouping columns based on some external compressor does not directly address the information redundancy arising from column dependencies. Further, the plan computation in Pzip, i.e., its column grouping, is slow and must be done off-line for an entire class of tables. As such, there is no recovery mechanism in Pzip if a computed plan
no longer matches the data characteristics in a particular table. In contrast, the presented algorithm delivers dependency transform computation which is fast and can be used on-line for each table. In fact, for large tables where the table characteristics may change between sufficiently long sequences of rows, a new dependency transform could be recomputed whenever compression degradation is detected. 

This is a very good paper that may be of good use for our research project. There are plenty of new compression algorithms available today. This is one to explore.
