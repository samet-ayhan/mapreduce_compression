Universal algorithm/Sequential data compression
- Data is subject to various structural regularities or subject to certain contraisnts.
- Theredfore storage and time-saving optimizations are needed for handling data.
- For an arbitary data source, identifying these contraints and regularities is the 
  primary task.
- Universal coding is needed if no prior knowledge of the source characteristics are avaialble.


Approach
- Encode future segments of the source-output via maximal length copying from a buffer that 
  contains the recent past output.
- Parse strings of symbols from a finite alphabet into substrings or words that do not exceed 
  pre-defined length.


Issues
- Universal coding requires a larger working memory space and employing performance criteria
  that fit wide variety of sources.
- Susceptibility to error propagation in the event of a channel error.

Solution
- Encoder designed to operate over a prescribed compression range performs as well as a one 
  designed to match a specific compression ratio.
- For a given complexity (codeword length) the compression efficiency is comparable to that of
  an optimal variable to block coding.
